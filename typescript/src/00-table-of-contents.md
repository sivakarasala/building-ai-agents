# Building CLI AI Agents from Scratch

A hands-on guide to building a fully functional AI agent with tool calling, evaluations, context management, and human-in-the-loop safety — all from scratch using TypeScript.

> Inspired by and adapted from [Hendrixer/agents-v2](https://github.com/Hendrixer/agents-v2) and the [AI Agents v2 course on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/ai-agents-v2/) by Scott Moss.

> 💻 **Companion code repo:** [Hendrixer/agents-v2](https://github.com/Hendrixer/agents-v2). The repo has one branch per chapter — check out `lesson-01` to start, and each `lesson-XX` branch is the starter for chapter XX (i.e. the completed state of the previous chapter). The `done` branch has the finished app.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this book, you'll have a working CLI AI agent that can:

- Read, write, and manage files on your filesystem
- Execute shell commands
- Search the web
- Execute code in multiple languages
- Manage long conversations with automatic context compaction
- Ask for human approval before performing dangerous operations
- Be tested with single-turn and multi-turn evaluations

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** — Type-safe development
- **Vercel AI SDK** — Universal LLM interface with streaming and tool calling
- **OpenAI** — LLM provider (gpt-5-mini)
- **React + Ink** — Terminal UI framework
- **Zod** — Schema validation for tool parameters
- **ShellJS** — Cross-platform shell commands
- **Laminar** — Observability and evaluation framework

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Node.js 20+
- An OpenAI API key ([platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com))
- Basic TypeScript/JavaScript knowledge (variables, functions, async/await, imports)
- Comfort running commands in a terminal (`npm install`, `npm run`)

**Not required:**
- Prior experience building CLI tools
- React knowledge (a primer is included in Chapter 9)
- AI/ML background — we explain everything from first principles
- A Laminar API key (optional, for tracking eval results over time)

## Table of Contents

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to AI Agents](./01-intro-to-agents.md)
What are AI agents? How do they differ from simple chatbots? Set up the project from scratch and make your first LLM call.

### [Chapter 2: Tool Calling](./02-tool-calling.md)
Define tools with Zod schemas and teach your agent to use them. Understand structured function calling and how LLMs decide which tools to invoke.

### [Chapter 3: Single-Turn Evaluations](./03-single-turn-evals.md)
Build an evaluation framework to test whether your agent selects the right tools. Write golden, secondary, and negative test cases.

### [Chapter 4: The Agent Loop](./04-the-agent-loop.md)
Implement the core agent loop — stream responses, detect tool calls, execute them, feed results back, and repeat until the task is done.

### [Chapter 5: Multi-Turn Evaluations](./05-multi-turn-evals.md)
Test full agent conversations with mocked tools. Use LLM-as-judge to score output quality. Evaluate tool ordering and forbidden tool avoidance.

### [Chapter 6: File System Tools](./06-file-system-tools.md)
Add real filesystem tools — read, write, list, and delete files. Handle errors gracefully and give your agent the ability to work with your codebase.

### [Chapter 7: Web Search & Context Management](./07-web-search-context-management.md)
Add web search capabilities. Implement token estimation, context window tracking, and automatic conversation compaction to handle long conversations.

### [Chapter 8: Shell Tool](./08-shell-tool.md)
Give your agent the power to run shell commands. Add a code execution tool that writes to temp files and runs them. Understand the security implications.

### [Chapter 9: Human-in-the-Loop](./09-human-in-the-loop.md)
Build an approval system for dangerous operations. Create a terminal UI with React and Ink that lets users approve or reject tool calls before execution.

### [Chapter 10: Going to Production](./10-going-to-production.md)
What's missing between your learning agent and a production agent. Error recovery, sandboxing, rate limiting, prompt injection defense, agent planning, multi-agent orchestration, a production readiness checklist, and recommended reading for going deeper.

## How to Read This Book

Each chapter builds on the previous one. You'll write every line of code yourself, starting from `npm init` and ending with a fully functional CLI agent.

Code blocks show exactly what to type. When we modify an existing file, we'll show the full updated file so you always have a clear picture of the current state.

By the end, your project will look like this:
